A cobbled together mess of existing monitoring solutions - to give visbility over the things we already have.

## ToDo

* ~~Add APScheduler~~
* Add Grafana Dashboards
* Add Support for Kibana for Ingress-Nginx
  - Record number of messages related to ingress-nginx pods for a specific time frame, plot them on graph, also show 24 hour combination of events
* Add Sentry support (Optional)
  - not sure what is the best approach here? Have a think about it.
  - Should use https://sentry.uksouth.bink.sh
* Swtich from ES to Prometheus?
